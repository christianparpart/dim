\<smath\> - symbolic math C++ library
=====================================

Small playground library for porting my F# code for fun to modern C++.

So, eventually this will become an **algebra library** with the following features:

- symbolic algebra
- linear algebra with compile time dimensions and templated underlying scalar
- probably some fourier transform (DFT, FFT, IDFT, IFFT)
